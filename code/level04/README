Welcome to the fourth level of our educational CTF!

This level's theme is: Ciphering 4.0 (Wow so many levels about ciphering!)

During this level you'll learn the basics about symmetric key ciphering!
##############################################################################

Symmetric key ciphering is a type of ciphering that uses the same key to
encipher plaintext and to decipher the ciphered text.

Do you remember level01? With the Caesar Cipher? What was the key used to
cipher the message? Yes, it was the shift value! But that was a pretty simple
key with a pretty basic method, but never the less this method was ciphering
with a symmetric key! Because the shift value had to be shared between the
sender and the receiver.

There are, of course, other methods and algorithms to perform symmetric key
ciphering. And usually the key size is somewhat larger than a simple number.

Since the key is shared between the group of people that want to exchange
messages or files, for example, it has to be pretty secure, or else that
could be a weakness prone to be exploited by an attacker. So what is
a secure password? A somewhat long and pseudo-randomly generated is usually
enough. When this key is common or made up of words, an attacker could try
to do a dictionary attack. This attack attempts to find the password by
testing multiple inputs that are available in certain list, a real dictionary
or a list of common passwords, for example.

You can now try this method of ciphering, going to the 'example' folder,
and reading the README there!

When you feel that you've learnt all of this go to the 'pass' folder and try
to advance to the following level!


See you there!
