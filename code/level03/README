Welcome to the third level of our educational CTF!

This level's theme is: Ciphering 3.0

During this level you'll learn the basics about public key ciphering!
##############################################################################

Right, you've already tried Caesar Ciphers and hashing and now you want to
know what to really do with ciphering!

This level will focus on public key ciphering and you'll learn how it works.

Using this method, e.g. to transmit a message between Alice and Bob, both
parties have a secret key and a public key that are mathematically linked.
In order to communicate Alice gets Bob's public key and enciphers her message
with it, and sends that to Bob. He, wanting to read what Alice has written,
deciphers the message using his private key. Only he could decipher the
message because a message enciphered with a public key can only be deciphered
using the corresponding private key.

This sounds great! But some assumptions must be made in order for this
transaction to occur without hiccups. Imagine that again Alice wants to speak
with Bob and doesn't have his public key. She asks him for it but Eve
intercepts this unciphered message and instead sends her public key.
Eve, being able to listen to Alice's communications, intercepts Alice's
message to Bob and deciphers it using her private key. Eve, pretending to be
Alice, can now cipher the message again using Bob's true public key.
Eve has now performed a "man in the middle" attack!
So the distribution of public keys should be made over a secure channel,
or by a trustworthy entity.

There are other uses for public key ciphering, like digital signatures,
but that will stay for another level!


You can now try this method of ciphering, going to the 'example' folder,
and reading the README there!

When you feel that you've learnt all of this go to the 'pass' folder and try
to advance to the following level!


See you there!
