So, let's say your name is Harry. Sorry if you're a girl, but now you are
Harry!

We've generated a public/private key combo for you.

Your keys are:
 > Private key: harry.key
 > Public key: harry.pub

You've received a message that your friend John sent you and, to securely
say what he wanted on a open channel, he enciphered it using your public key!

So what to do now? You want to read it right?
Don't Panic! It's easy :)

You just have to run a simple application to decipher the message.
Try this:
 > openssl rsautl -in ciphered.txt -decrypt -inkey harry.key -out message.txt

It's easy to explain each argument:
 - You run the openssl application with the rsautl command. This RSA utility
 can be used for some tasks including ciphering and deciphering data.

 - The -in represents the ciphered message that you want to decipher

 - Using -decrypt we inform the program that we want to decipher the input
  file, remember that the rsautl command serves for more that just
  deciphering. And yes, decrypt==decipher, they are synonyms.

 - The -inkey represents the key to use, in this case we use the private key.

 - And finally the -out signals to which file to save the output of the
 deciphered message!

I'm sure you're hands on so you've just tried that and are now ready to
decipher the password to the next level! Go to the ../pass folder and
get your hands dirty again!

See you on the next level!
