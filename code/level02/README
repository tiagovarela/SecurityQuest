Welcome to the second level of our educational CTF!

This level's theme is: Ciphering 2.0

During this level you'll learn the basics about hashing!

Hashing is also a part of ciphering! But what's this hashing thing I'm talking
about?

Hashing is a way for you to compress a file's information to a fixed number
of bits, but it's a one-way compression! This means that you cannot obtain
the original file from the hashed value!

Did I mention that this value is unique to each file you have? The same file
generates the same value, but different files, even if the changes are minimal
generate completely different hashes!

For example, if I have a file with the content:
 > This SecurityQuest is Awesome.
The MD5 hash of that would be:
 > a0ca7700489c78d916b7b9615217e8f4

However, if you do a small change to the content like:
 > This SecurityQuest is really Awesome.
The MD5 hash of that file is completely different from the previous version:
 > 2d561641f92d497884f53df18fb39533


As you've noticed this is a very good way to check if a file was modified,
i.e. check its integrity. For example, when you download a large file, such
as the install image of a distro like Ubuntu, there is usually a MD5 hash
that is provided alongside that file. With this you can check the integrity
of the file that was downloaded to make sure that there weren't cosmic rays
flipping the bits of your download.

In this level you'll check the integrity of some files. The first 8 characters
of the modified file's hash is the password to the next level! These files are
in the 'pass' folder.

Oh and I almost forgot! To see the MD5 hash of a file just run:
 > md5sum <filename>

We'll give you a hint: It's possible to list the hashes of all the files
in a folder :) that will make it easier to find the most recent version of
the modified file.

See you on the next level!
